Machine Learning is a powerful technology having the potential to find practical solutions to problems in diverse fields. In machine learning, there are many techniques used to train the data and get the output.

## 1. Supervised Learning

In Supervised Learning, an algorithm learns from a dataset. We give the data as well as the output corresponding to each input. The algorithm learns from the given data and next time if we enter the data, it will give the output in accordance with the given data. The data provided can be of two types:

+ **Discrete:** In discrete data, we use classification. Classification is the process where incoming data is labeled based on past data samples and manually trains the algorithm to recognize certain types of objects and categorize them accordingly.
+ **Continuous:** For continuous data, we use regression. Regression is the process of identifying patterns and calculating the predictions of continuous outcomes.

Some widely used supervised learning algorithms are:

+ Linear regression
+ Logistical Regression
+ Random Forest
+ Support Vector Machines (SVM)
+ Decision Trees
+ Naive Bayes
+ Nearest Neighbor

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

In Unsupervised Learning, an algorithm is provided with only the data. We do not know the output or the result of the data. The algorithm groups the data or make clusters of the data to make labels and when we provide data next time, it checks for the best cluster or group to which the input data should belong, to give the output. Clustering is the best example of unsupervised learning.

Some widely used unsupervised learning algorithms are:
- k-means clustering
- k-medoid clustering
- PCA

> The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data.

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-Supervised Learning is, basically, the combination of Supervised and Unsupervised learning. It combines some aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. We have both labeled as well as unlabeled data, so the algorithms make groups or clusters as well as put labels on the data to train the model.

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

In Reinforcement Learning, the algorithms train the model and give output. Then the output is reviewed whether it is correct or not and gives feedback to the model. The model learns from the feedback and improves itself. The model keeps on improving throughout. Overall, the model tries to maximize positive feedback and minimize the negatives. It is used when we have incomplete or inconsistent data available.

Some widely used reinforcement learning algorithms are:
- Q-Learning
- Temporal Difference (TD)
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C)

_As we can see, for different types of data and different kinds of problems, we have different types of machine learning techniques available. We can make a powerful model, capable of handling a wide variety of tasks, by the combination of these machine learning techniques._
